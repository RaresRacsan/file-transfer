- Collaborate in ways that ensure clarity and accountability.
- Offer and receive feedback graciously, with the intent of improving the project.

### Unacceptable Behavior
- Insults, derogatory comments, or personal attacks.
- Posting content that is discriminatory, harassing, or offensive.
- Unhelpful contributions, including incomplete or non-functional code submissions.
- Misrepresenting the origin of work, including submitting AI-generated code without adequate testing and understanding of the solution.
