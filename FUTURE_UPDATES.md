# Future Updates for File Transfer App

## Current State:
The application allows for basic file transfers between a client and server using TCP sockets. It supports multiple file types (including `.exe` and `.c` files), but it is still a simple and foundational implementation.

## Planned Features and Enhancements:

### 1. **Security Enhancements**
   - **Implement Encryption**: Add SSL/TLS support to encrypt the file transfer, ensuring secure communication between the client and server.
   - **Authentication**: Introduce user authentication to verify the identity of both the client and the server before allowing file transfers.

### 2. **Improved Error Handling**
   - **Large File Transfers**: Ensure the program can handle large files, including splitting large files into smaller chunks for transfer.
   - ~~**File Integrity Check**: Implement checksum to verify the integrity of transferred files and ensure they are received correctly.~~ ✔

### 3. **File Metadata**
   - **Send File Metadata**: Before transferring files, send metadata (file name, size, type) to the client for better file management.
   - **Improved File Naming**: Handle special characters in file names and support renaming files if they already exist on the client-side.

### 4. **Directory Support**
   - **Transfer Directories**: Allow transferring entire directories by packaging them into a compressed format (e.g., `.zip` or `.tar`) and extracting them on the client side.

### 5. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**
   - **Linux / macOS Support**: Ensure that the application works across multiple platforms, including Windows, Linux, and macOS. Address any platform-specific issues, such as file path formatting.
   - **CLI/GUI Interface for Cross-Platform Usage**: Consider adding a more user-friendly interface (CLI or GUI) to make it easier for users who aren't familiar with terminal commands.

### 6. **Performance Optimizations**
   - **Compression**: Implement file compression (e.g., using `zlib`) to speed up transfer times, especially for larger files.
   - **Parallel Transfers**: Implement multi-threading or asynchronous operations to allow multiple files to be transferred concurrently for faster performance.

### 7. **Error/Connection Recovery**
   - **Resuming File Transfers**: Enable the ability to resume an interrupted file transfer without starting from scratch.
   - **Timeouts and Retry Logic**: Add logic to handle network timeouts and automatically retry failed transfers.

### 8. **Better User Interface / Experience**
   - **CLI Improvements**: Improve the command-line interface with better prompts and user feedback.
   - **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Design and implement a GUI to make the application more accessible for non-technical users.
