## Feature Overview
**What is the purpose of this feature?**
- Provide a clear and concise summary of the feature.
- Example: "Implement a graphical user interface (GUI) for the client application using GTK."

## Objectives
**What are the key goals of this feature?**
1. Describe the specific objectives or tasks.
   - Example:
     - Create a GUI to select files for transfer.
     - Display transfer progress and status messages.

## Requirements
**What are the technical and functional requirements for this feature?**
- Functional Requirements:
  - What should the feature do?
  - Example: "The GUI should allow users to select a file via a file picker dialog."
- Technical Requirements:
  - What tools, libraries, or protocols will be used?
  - Example: "GTK 3 library is required for creating the GUI."

## Design and Architecture
**Describe the design and technical architecture:**
1. Diagrams (if applicable):
   - Add UML diagrams, flowcharts, or mockups.
2. Key components:
   - Example: "Create a `client_gui.c` module for the GTK-based GUI implementation."

## Implementation Plan
**Outline the steps to implement the feature:**
1. Initialize the GTK environment in `main()`.
2. Design the GUI layout using GTK widgets.
3. Add event handlers for buttons and file selection.
4. Integrate file transfer logic with the GUI.

## Testing Plan
**Describe how this feature will be tested:**
1. Unit Tests:
   - Example: "Test the file picker functionality."
2. Integration Tests:
   - Example: "Verify that the GUI correctly integrates with the file transfer logic."
3. End-to-End Tests:
   - Example: "Run a complete file transfer using the GUI and check for any errors."
